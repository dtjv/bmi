#### Philosophy

> The human body is capable of so much more than most people realize. My goal as a coach and trainer is to help my clients achieve their full potential and take their minds and bodies to the level they never thought possible

#### Testimonials

> Any personal trainer can teach exercises and suggest diet changes to help a client lose a few pounds. What is special and rare, is a personal trainer who can inspire a client to make fitness an integral part of their life. This is what Amy Chang has done for me. I have been working with Amy for several years and she has inspired and supported me beyond measure. She has taught me success doesn't necessarily mean a decreasing number on a scale, but rather how setting a goal like getting to the gym 5 days a week without exception can and will make you successful. She has encouraged me to think outside my comfort zone and push to achieve goals like training for and running a half marathon. More importantly, she has taught me that it's not about being accountable to my trainer every week, but rather to myself. Thanks to Amy, I have and continue to achieve my fitness goals.

> Amy made me sweat and groan for every ounce lost and/or redistributed - and I would still highly recommend her to anyone looking for a personal fitness trainer! I became Amy's reluctant client several years ago at the urging of my family.  I was overweight, lethargic and eating really badly. With a lot of patience, Amy brushed aside all of my excuses and worked to make me stronger. She emphasized correct form (to avoid injuries) and set a pace which was definitely hard but not punishing. After I started feeling stronger and less lethargic, Amy steered me towards group exercise classes to add a cardio component to my workouts. She also started making suggestions about my diet. Overall, she inspired me feel that I had to be more accountable to myself for my over all health and well-being.

> Today I'm two dress sizes smaller, more energetic and much more conscious of my eating habits. My improvements encouraged my husband to sign on as Amy's client. We have such confidence in Amy that we asked her to help our 14 year old daughter stay in shape when our daughter was recovering from foot surgery. The best thing about Amy - even if she doesn't say it - you know that she sincerely wants you to succeed in reaching your health goals and that she's with you every step of the (difficult) way.
