> I've been training with Thao for several years now and am in the best shape of my life. She has helped me through several injuries and has also provided special training for different activities. Thao has increased my core strength and my flexibility which has helped me in golf, skiing, triathlons and half marathons. She motivates me and pushes me to my limits and makes each and every workout unique so I do not get bored with coming to the gym. I really like the facilities at BMI Fitness as they have all the equipment I need for a complete workout, TRX, cardio machines, free weights, cable machines, Pilates equipment and Thao incorporates all of these into my workouts. Thanks to Thao I have been able to maintain my health and fitness.

> Thao is a terrific trainer.  I am a man in my late sixties with creaky knees and sore shoulders, Thao has kept me moving and active with no pain.  I am still playing golf regularly, hiking and walking with my wife and chasing around seven grandchildren.  She has designed routines just for me to address my injuries and cure my bad habits.  She has guided me through many Pilates sessions that increased my core strength and reclaimed my flexibility.  BMI Fitness and Thao have been a great fit for me.  Whether it be rehab, strength conditioning or general good health, Thao will enthusiastically guide you to success.

> **- Jim Q.**

> I started working with Thao a couple of years ago on the recommendation of a colleague after an injury on the ski slopes. Before that I had worked with Pilates coaches in four different studios. Thao is the best! I love the way she combines Pilates, strength-training, and myofascial release with the result that my alignment and strength have improved significantly. Her knowledge of the ways bodies work and the ways our minds can work against us is awesome. Add to that the fun it is to work with her. Can we ask for anything more?
